//This is the label selector - All actions in here relate to label button on the header and its functions 
// Importantly these actions are dependant on if the user is logged in or not. 
// In the header the labelAction dispatch will populate a navigation menu that slides out from the left.
// That menu will be populated by either the users saved content (if they have an account) or
// or dummy data.
