WELCOME TO RECORD LABEL CURRATION ASSISTANT

A small application to help you curate your physical music collection around your favorite labels. 

Why was this app created? I have been around fans of physical music media for many years now and often find they, as opposed to following the work of musicians, will follow the output of record labels. 

I created this app as a way for collectors to keep better track of their collections by organizing them by label and providing the user a clean UI to catalogue their collection. 

Here is how the App is set up. 

File Structure:

The app is sectioned off into relevant folders which are explained below.

REDUX - Housing the reducers and actions
PAGES - Housing sub-folders for each section of the APP, these section are as follows:
<br>
  SIGN IN
  <br>
  DASHBOARD
  <br>
  NAVIGATION
  <br>
  SEARCH
  <br>
UTILS - Housing all the exports required on many pages to give functionalilty to the app. These include but are not limited to:
  <br>DATADIVINER - A function named after the piece of electronic music by the New Zealand duo Pitch Black. This small function       handles the API requests by taking the url as a parameter and returning an array with the API's data.
<br>  API ENDPOINTS - a file the exports all the relevant API endpoints. The API in use is the Discogs API. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
